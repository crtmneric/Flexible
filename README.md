# Flexible
The FlexiblePhysio reduces the cost of medical treatment by 65% by eliminating the physician's and hospital fears. It enables the patient to do physical therapy applications on his own.Especially the pediatric patient is prepared for the target mass. With FlexiblePhysio virtual reality and wearable technology, color modes and tasks and the treatment process are brought to another dimension.FlexiblePhysio, which is introduced by the web interface for physicians to follow the practices of the patients and direct them to patients, offers the possibility of treatment at home or at home.
FlexiblePhysio is a biomedical business idea combined with virtual reality and wearable technology in the field of physical therapy, which accelerates, simplifies and reduces financial costs of the recovery process.FlexiblePhysio includes IoT (internet of objects) and wearable technology. Flexible sensors can be integrated into the body part of the patient's body to treat the patient.FlexiblePhysio is wearable only with Wi-Fi, portable power supply (li-po battery), flexible sensors and a micro controller.
# Unity Client
Project has a smooth data flow alghorithm with a brilliant idea. 
Arduino------>Write Potantiometer data to .txt file -----> Unity Scripts reads data from same .txt file ------> Real Time Virtual physical therapy
We will add 3D Models and Arduino side soon.
